# 0hh1

An iOS adaptation of the puzzle game, 0hh1, originally created by Martin Kool (https://0hh1.com/). Created user interface with SpriteKit, created multi page views with StoryBoards, and created buttons by subclassing the SKNode class. Implemented class to class delegation in Swift to exchange gameplay data, and protocols to facilitate said delegation.
